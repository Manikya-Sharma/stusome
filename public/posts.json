    "content": "> Stress is a mental situation in which a person feels ***overwhelmed*** and is unable to work productively. It is one of the most common ***psychological problem*** faced by humans these days\n\n# How it happens\n\nThere can be many reasons why college students might get stressed. It might be that they are unable to finish their project. Or maybe they are not able to get good scores in exams. Some might be stressed due to competition for internships and jobs. There might also be many personal reasons which act as precursors for stress.\n\n# Coping up with stress\n\nThere are some well tested ways to cope up with stress, they are: -\n\n## Physical workout\n\nAlthough not very obvious, but few minutes of exercise can help to reduce stress levels significantly.\n\n## Keeping a hobby\n\nA hobby such as dancing, reading, debating etc. can help a person to not lose the purpose of life and it helps keep him or her motivated.\n\n# What to do if my friend/ family member is stressed?\n\nIn such a case, you should try to make them talk out their problems, many times this itself can heal the other person. You can give your own example to make them realize that such a situation is common and it will pass on. You should try to motivate them but at the same time also provide them some personal time in which they can reflect upon themselves.",

    "content": "# Why coding is important\n\nCoding has, in recent times, become an essential skill which everyone should know. It gives the capability to utilize the speed and accuracy of computers. It can benefit in automating mundane tasks.\n\n > For engineers, coding is a must since it is one of those technical skills which can help on a long run.\n\n# Ways to learn coding\n\nThere can be different ways to learn coding, they depend upon the final place one wants to reach.\n* For automating day to day tasks: In such a case, python is the best language to begin with. It has an easy to read syntax and many pre-built libraries. A hello world program in python is like this\n\n```py\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n* For making performant/ business quality programs: In such a case, one of the best approach is to start learning with C and C++ and then move on to higher level languages. A hello world program in C would be like\n```c\n#include<stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n\treturn 0;\n}\n```\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTherefore, we finally conclude that the perfect way to learn coding is different for different people and you should take the pathway that you like the most.",
